# Restaurant Inspections: Surrey

This is an Android app which downloads restaurant inspection data from the [City of Surrey database](http://data.surrey.ca/) 
and displays data for all restaurants in Surrey, British Columbia, (currently over 1000) either in alphabetical list form or as pegs on a map using the Google Maps API. The user can apply filters to limit the number of restaurants being viewed. When opened, the app will check with the database to see if there is new data to be downloaded. 
If so, the app asks for permission to download the new data. If the user has favourited any restaurants that have received new inspections, they will be notified via dialog. 

If you would like to run this app yourself, clone the repo into Android Studio and install/run the app on a Pixel 2 API 29 emulator. You can also install through USB and run it on your own device, although I have not tested it on a wide range of devices.

[Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNrZBCeCSN8&feature=youtu.be) I created to help my team members use the Issue feature of GitLab.

This app was a collaboration between myself and 3 other team members for CMPT 276 - Introduction to Software Engineering at Simon Fraser University. My commits are under rcmcg, reecem, or Reece McGowan.
